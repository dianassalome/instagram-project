Project Title: Social Network App

Description: This project is a simple social network app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of two main pages: a login/sign-up page and a user profile page. The login/sign-up page allows users to create a new account or log in to an existing one. Once logged in, users can view their profile page, where they can see their posts, followers, and following count. Users can also follow/unfollow other users and upload new posts with images and descriptions. The project uses local storage to store user data.

Note: The project is created for educational purposes and does not include a backend server for data storage. It is purely a front-end implementation and serves as a practice project for learning web development concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling.
